Concept Overview

The UI can be built as an interactive chart, specifically an X/Y axis graph. The X-axis represents "Liberal to Conservative" content, and the Y-axis represents "Objective to Subjective." This setup allows users to rate content in one of four quadrants based on their perception. Here are some possible components:

Graph Layout

X-Axis: The horizontal axis moves from Liberal on the left to Conservative on the right.

Y-Axis: The vertical axis moves from Objective at the top to Subjective at the bottom.

The four quadrants would be:

Top Left: Objective Liberal

Bottom Left: Subjective Liberal

Top Right: Objective Conservative

Bottom Right: Subjective Conservative

Interactive Elements

Draggable Pin: Users can place a draggable pin anywhere on the graph to rate a specific piece of content. For example, they could place the pin in the Top Left quadrant if they feel the content is both liberal and objective.

Tooltip: When the user drags the pin, show a tooltip that provides the exact coordinates (e.g., (Liberal 70%, Subjective 40%)) and a short description of the position.

Content Box

Input Field: Provide an area where the user can input or select the content they want to rate (e.g., a URL, article title, or even upload a document).

Content Preview: Display a brief preview of the content they are rating for context, so users can make an informed choice.

User Feedback

Confirmation Button: Once a rating is selected, users can click a button (e.g., Submit Rating) to confirm their choice.

Previous Ratings: Include an option for users to view their previously rated content on a list next to the graph.

Data Visualization

Heat Map Overlay: You could also use a heat map overlay to indicate how other users have rated content on the same graph, providing insight into community sentiment.

Labels and Instructions

Clear Labels: Label the axes clearly with terms like Objective/Subjective and Liberal/Conservative.

Instructions Panel: Add a panel that explains how to use the UI, including definitions for "Objective," "Subjective," "Liberal," and "Conservative," to guide users who may be unfamiliar with the terminology.

User Features

User Signup and Login

Add a Signup Div at the top of the page where users can create an account by providing a username, password, and email address or login to their profile.

After signup, users can log in to access their personalized profile and ratings on their profile page.

User Profile Page

Profile Overview: Users can view their account details such as username and email.

Rated Content List: Display a list of content that the user has rated, along with their rating details and the option to edit or delete a rating.

Sharing Ratings

Allow users to share their ratings to popular social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn.

Provide a Share Button that integrates with social media APIs (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn) for seamless sharing of the generated rating image and link.

Maintain the existing functionality to download the rating as an image.

Technologies to Use

Front-End: You can use JavaScript libraries like D3.js or Chart.js for creating interactive and responsive graphs.

Backend: Use free lightweight web-based tools where possible.

Styling: Use CSS (with possible frameworks like Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap) to ensure that the UI looks clean and intuitive.

Authentication: Use a free web-based tool for managing user sessions and authentication.

Social Media Sharing: Use appropriate APIs for platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn to allow seamless sharing.

Example User Flow

User Signup and Login

The user signup and login features are at the top of the rating page in their own div. If the user is logged in they use the tool, if not they can login or sign up where the user visits the signup page, provides their details, and creates an account.

If the user is logged in they can rate and save their rating or be directed to their profile page.

Profile Page

The user can see their average rating displayed on the graph as the default pin position.

The user can view a list of content they have rated and choose to edit or delete any rating.

Rating Content

The user selects content to rate by URL or via a browser extension.

The user drags the pin on the graph to indicate their perceived placement of the content.

The user confirms their rating by clicking the submit button.

Sharing and Downloading

After submitting the rating, the user can either download an image of the rating or share the rating directly to social media via the provided share button, which integrates social media APIs for sharing the generated rating image.
